# How many threads use for synchronous methods (services).

# it should be slightly more, say 100-300.
THREAD_POOL_SIZE = 300

# RPC call throws TimeoutServiceException once total time since request has been
# placed (time to delivery to client + time for processing on the client)

# Low value leads to more frequent session reinitializing (like downloading address history).
HTTP_SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600 # in seconds
